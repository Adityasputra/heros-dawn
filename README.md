# Hero’s Dawn (Work in Progress 🚧)

A retro-inspired fantasy RPG UI built with **native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
This project simulates the feel of a classic RPG with a title screen, character status, quest log, inventory, NPC dialogs, and background music — all running directly in the browser.
